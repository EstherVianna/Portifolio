# 🖥️ Portfolio Project

## ⌨ Desciption
Portfolio created to demonstrate my habilities as a front-end developer, where I can show the projects I'm proud of and let people and companies know about my services a nd knowledge, and the value of my job to solve their problems and let their desires come true.

## ✍🏽 Process

- Created and recreated design based in a main caracter: the frontal image;
- HTML | CSS;
- Javascript (React will be added in a near future);
- Responsive design;

## 🪄 Own inspiration
In this project, I tried to do something outside the dev bubble! No neon colors, no purple and blue color palette. I had only one thing in mind: to represent my skin color and where I come from, to show everybody that I am a black woman and am capable of anything I want. Some people start from nothing and we just have to keep moving forward!
